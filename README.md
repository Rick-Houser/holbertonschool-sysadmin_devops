# Dev-Ops track at Holberton School.

This repo contains code from our Dev-Ops programming track at Holberton School. In this track we learn many topics. Here you'll find all sorts of Ruby and Shell scripts here. My favorite project would have to be "choice_the_voice_of_your_ai" (described below).

Not only did we learn to do some really cool stuff with scripts, but by being on the School's internal DevOps team, we got to provision computers and use industry tech like Jira and JAMF.

## DevOps Tasks and Tech:

1. Parsing files and folders
1. Managing AWS S3 buckets
1. Managing EC2 instances
1. Configure master/slave relationships
1. SSH
1. RegEx
1. Jira
1. JAMF
1. Chef
1. Convert from base10 to base16
1. Various algorithms using scripts

## Choice the Voice of your Ai

Funny name but very fun project. The script parses the CLI. Given a string, a voice option, and an IP address, the script takes the string and uploads a spoken version of the string in a voice of your choice. Current voice options are male(m), female(f) and robot(r).

## **_Usage_**

* Run the script from the CLI

  ```bash
  ./script_name 'my string' f IP_ADDRESS
  ```
